I'm a 21 year old software engineer finishing up my education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'll be graduating in May, with majors in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Data Science. I'll then be moving out to the Bay Area in July to start my job as a Software Engineer at Meta.

I'm especially interested in applications of AI, specifically detecting misinformation, generative AI, and autonomous driving.
